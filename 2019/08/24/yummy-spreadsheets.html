<h3 id="the-pitch">The pitch</h3>

<p>Thereâ€™s no side project more satisfying than one that optimises my day-to-day life in some even very small way.</p>

<p>It doesnâ€™t matter to me if hundreds of similar solutions already exist and many are well designed and available for free. None of them will ever work in <em>exactly the way I want them to</em> and integrate seamlessly with my current habits.*</p>

<p>*<em>Iâ€™d like to make it clear to any potential employers that this is a philosophy I apply to side projects but not in my professional work where I aim to be unflinchingly pragmatic.</em></p>

<h3 id="i-3-spreadsheets">I &lt;3 spreadsheets</h3>

<p>As anyone whoâ€™s ever shared a residence with me will tell you, I love a good spreadsheet. Arguably Iâ€™ve made spreadsheets to solve problems I donâ€™t really have, but I take a lot of joy in them all the same.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/adventure-time-spreadsheet.png" alt="my adventure time watch record spreadsheet" class="edgeless-image" />
(case in point: my adventure time watch record spreadsheet)</p>

<p>Perhaps my favourite is my <em>recipe spreadsheet</em>, which has matured over the past few years, and is a nice way for me to record all the dinners Iâ€™ve made that I want to remember for another time (and those I should remember to avoid).</p>

<h3 id="inconvenience-food">Inconvenience food</h3>

<p>However, every time I want to plan a week of meals I have to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click through to each of my chosen recipes and for each one close on average maybe 4 obstructive adverts and/or privacy policy banners</li>
  <li>Find the list of ingredients on each page (not always as easy as you might imagine)</li>
  <li>Manually merge ingredient quantities, e.g. 2 onions for 1 meal + 1 onion for another = 3 onions</li>
  <li>Manually group the items roughly by location so Iâ€™m not zigzagging around the crowded supermarket in red-faced frustration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="automate-the-boring-stuff">Automate the boring stuff</h3>

<p><em>So</em> I made a thing which will do the tedious work for me ðŸŽ‰ Thereâ€™s a bit of upfront tedium in getting all the ingredients for each meal in a neat format but itâ€™s only once per meal and when itâ€™s in the spirit of saving time in the future, it can even be fun (uh, in my opinion).</p>

<p>This side project used the following tech:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NodeJS (what else?)</li>
  <li>TypeScript (Ooh, type-safety, how novel)</li>
  <li>Serverless/AWS Lambda (Itâ€™s the future)</li>
  <li>The Google sheets API</li>
  <li>Some <em>sick</em> google sheets formulas that I was very pleased with</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ll go into more detail on how this went later on.</p>

<h3 id="sharing-is-caring">Sharing is caring</h3>

<p>Mate, you can use this too! If you want.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a generic meal spreadsheet I adapted from the one Iâ€™ve honed over a period of extended and regular use and have poured lots of love into. You can copy it and make your own:</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jxZ8m7SKLJ4_YwjqKP6gg3QKQIGM7Ch9Bnv0Ttu5zkI/edit">Generic meal spreadsheet</a></p>

<p>And hereâ€™s the codez, which you can deploy to your own Amazon Web Services account, if youâ€™re so inclined:</p>

<p><a href="github.com/laurieboyes/sheets-shop">github.com/laurieboyes/sheets-shop</a></p>

<h3 id="how-does-it-work-though">How does it work though?</h3>

<p>So I have my meals spreadsheet. Every time I try out a new recipe, I add it to the list, along with a load of extra data.*</p>

<p>*<em>Juuust in case youâ€™re interested, my extra data includes:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Comments, such as â€˜Nice but go easier on the szechuan pepper next time because Soph thought she was having a strokeâ€™</em></li>
  <li><em>When we last had it (being able to sort by recency is good because it makes it easier to find things weâ€™ve not had in a while)</em></li>
  <li><em>Whether we typically get any leftovers out of it</em></li>
  <li><em>Whether itâ€™s sufficiently low-effort to make on a weeknight</em></li>
  <li><em>Whether I can get all the ingredients from the Tesco Express nearby</em></li>
  <li><em>Whether itâ€™s vegetarian (Iâ€™m not currently a vegetarian but itâ€™s good to when Iâ€™m considering entertaining)</em></li>
  <li><em>Total time taken (for the rare occasion on which I remember to record it)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ve added a new checkbox field to the spreadsheet so I can select which ones I want included in my shopping list:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/checkbox.png" alt="checkbox" class="edgeless-image" />
How neat is that</p>

<p>On another sheet, Iâ€™ve entered my list of ingredients for each of my meals:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/ingredients.png" alt="ingredients" class="edgeless-image" /></p>

<p>Cool.</p>

<p>And on yet another sheet (I did warn you about the upfront labour), I have a list of ingredients and their types:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/ingredient-types.png" alt="ingredient-types" class="edgeless-image" /></p>

<p>Cool cool cool, ready to go.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m getting ready to head out to the shops, I tick the checkboxes against each of my desired meals, and click the link to the API Gateway thatâ€™s in front of my shopping list generator lambda function.</p>

<p>The lambda function uses the Google Sheets API to ask my spreadsheet what up and what the ingredients are for the meals I want.</p>

<p>It then munges together all the ingredient quantities, with some degree of tolerance for different units (e.g. itâ€™ll happily merge grams and kilograms), sorts them by their â€˜typesâ€™ I also defined on the spreadsheet, and returns me a nice convenient list:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/finished-list.png" alt="finished-list" class="edgeless-image" /></p>

<p>It may not be pretty visually, but a low-stress supermarket experience is a beautiful thing.</p>

<h3 id="bits-that-were-interesting-relatively">Bits that were interesting (relatively)</h3>

<p>Iâ€™ll spare you <em>all</em> of the details, but certain parts of this side project were particularly fun to do.</p>

<h4 id="parsing-the-ingredients">Parsing the ingredients</h4>

<p>I needed a way of entering ingredients that found a compromise between making them easy to add and making it easy for my list generator to understand them with its hyper-literal robot mind.</p>

<p>After a small amount of deliberation I settled on a system where the first token (by which I mean all of the characters before the first space) always defines the quantity:</p>

<p><span class="highlight">3cloves</span> garlic<br />
<span class="highlight">some</span> fresh ginger<br />
<span class="highlight">4</span> spring onions<br />
<span class="highlight">1tsp</span> szechuan peppercorns<br /></p>

<p>This system gives the my code a leg up in understanding whatâ€™s going on, as it can easily pick out the text before the first space. Itâ€™s then a case of using regular expressions to pick out the number and, if there is one, the unit.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/ingredients-regex.gif" alt="ingredients-regex" class="edgeless-image" />
I <em>love</em> it when I find a good reason to use regular expressions (thanks <a href="https://regex101.com/">regex101.com</a>)</p>

<p>Itâ€™s also pretty easy to enter them with my human typing fingers, so itâ€™s a win-win</p>

<h4 id="some-sick-google-sheets-formulas-formulae">Some <em>sick</em> google sheets formulas (formulae?)</h4>

<p>This project definitely stretched my spreadsheet formula skills and it was always with a mixture of pride and relief when I finally got each of these working.</p>

<p>Sick formula number 1: Retrieve the value of the checkbox on the meals sheet to copy it onto the ingredients sheet (for slightly easier Google Sheets API querying)</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>=VLOOKUP(G1, INDIRECT("The other spreadsheet!A:B"), 2)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/checkbox-copy-formula.gif" alt="checkbox-copy-formula" class="edgeless-image" /></p>

<p>Sick formula number 2: Conditional formatting to indicate if a selected recipe doesnâ€™t have an entry in the ingredients sheet:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>=AND(B1 = TRUE,COUNTIF(INDIRECT("'Ingredients'!1:1"),A1) &lt;= 0)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/no-ingreeds-formula.png" alt="no-ingreeds-formula" class="edgeless-image" />
Red means <em>danger</em>.</p>

<p>Sick formula number 3: Conditional formatting to indicate when an ingredient doesnâ€™t have a category defined on the Ingredient types sheet:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>=AND(NOT(ISBLANK(H4)),COUNTIF(INDIRECT("'Ingredient types'!A:A"),RIGHT(H4,LEN(H4) - FIND(" ", H4))) &lt;= 0)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/yummy-spreadsheets/no-type-formula.png" alt="no-type-formula" class="edgeless-image" />
The consequences of this are just that it wonâ€™t be grouped together with its collocated ingredients in the resulting list, so this orangey yellow colour will do for severity.</p>

<h3 id="talking-tech">Talking tech</h3>

<p>Here are my thoughts, feelings, and motivations around the tech choices I made for this.</p>

<h4 id="typescript">TypeScript</h4>

<p>The first time I encountered TypeScript was in December 2016 when one of my favourite colleagues used it to write a new service as his final contribution before departing the company. When I subsequently came to maintaining it, I was overcome with frustration and disbelief at how difficult I was finding it to make my simple changes. He told me later that one day weâ€™d all see the light, and itâ€™s important to me that he never finds out that he was right and that these days I actually think itâ€™s super useful.</p>

<p>The usefulness of type safety stole up on me gradually. Having made the decision a couple of years into my career to reject Java and all its mad verbosity for the free-and-easy alternative that was JavaScript, I had come to see static typing as a hangover from a less âœ¨agile âœ¨time.</p>

<p>But then more recently I found myself encountering bugs and thinking â€˜dang, I should have written a unit test to check thatâ€™ or â€˜dang, I should have put some defensive type checks in for those function parametersâ€™, and then it occurred to me that <em>instead</em> I could do what lots of other JavaScript fans are doing these days and write in TypeScript.</p>

<p>A turning point for me was when I heard that you can write TypeScript but still keep it loosey goosey by allowing for â€˜implicit anyâ€™ (â€˜anyâ€™ as in â€˜anything goesâ€™) so you didnâ€™t have to actually write any type definitions if you donâ€™t want to, and you can add them later where you feel theyâ€™ll be most useful.</p>

<p>This is how I approached it in this project and it was great. I ended up writing just a few types but they were very helpful. I really like the fact that if I want to add a new property to a type, I can update an interface and itâ€™ll immediately tell me everywhere in the project I need to update the code that uses it. Itâ€™s like really low-rent magic.</p>

<p><em>(In the n months since I wrote this system/blog though, my TypeScript usage has evolved and Iâ€™ve done away with implicit any)</em></p>

<h4 id="serverless-framework--aws-lambda">Serverless framework + AWS Lambda</h4>

<p>I absolutely love working with serverless stuff now. It just feels so easy to get stuff going.</p>

<p>A big part of this is <a href="https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/">the Serverless framework</a>, which is a properly good framework for deploying cloud functions and configuring event sources such as API Gateways and time schedules with super easy config. Iâ€™m not exaggerating. I love it.</p>

<p>AWS Lambda got even better in April 2018 (shortly before I wrote this system) when it started allowing you to run stuff in Node 8.10, opening the door to my new favourite syntactic sweeties, <code class="highlighter-rouge">async</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">await</code>, which made for some very neat promise-based asynchronous code.</p>

<h4 id="the-google-sheets-rest-api">The Google Sheets REST API</h4>

<p>Iâ€™m glad I chose to go with the sheets API route. The alternative was to write a script in the Google Sheets script editor and dumping the results into another sheet. I have had a go at this sort of thing before but found it a bit of an uphill struggle, and it leaves no room for nice unit tests or TypeScript or whatever.</p>

<p>The API is fairly intuitive to use and very nicely documented (Iâ€™m sure if youâ€™re interested youâ€™ll google it but here are the Google Sheets REST API docs anyway).</p>

<h3 id="bon-appÃ©tit">Bon appÃ©tit</h3>

<p>In conclusion, this was a fun mini project and Iâ€™ll be making use of its fruits for many years to come. Hooray!</p>

<p>As I mentioned, if you wanted to try and integrate this approach into your own life, Iâ€™ve made my code and my spreadsheet template (with all those juicy formulas) available for all. Find them in the <a href="#sharing-is-caring">Sharing is caring section</a>.</p>
