  <section class="post-content"><p>In April 2014, after many opportunities passing by with excuses or genuine poor timing, I finally committed myself to participating in the <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare 48-hour game competition</a>.</p>

<p>My entry was, uh, pretty weird. The theme, announced at the very start of the 48-hour window late on the Friday evening, was <em>Beneath the surface</em>. Many people entered underwater themed games, or mining games. I decided that my game would take a look <em>beneath the surface</em> of  my own fragile outward calm.</p>

<p><em>Move: wasd</em><br /> 
<em>Shoot: arrow keys</em><br />
<em>Start, next level: space bar</em></p>

<p>Fundamentally, it’s a very basic shooter game. The enemies are my insecurities, and some of them spout fun exaggerations on my own internal monologue. When a player collides with an insecurity, they are presented with a picture of my face, moving through an array of increasingly distressed expressions.</p>

<p>Did I win? No! Of course not. But I was pretty happy with my results. Competing against a not insignificant 2495 entries, I came in 14th place for humour (putting me in the top 1 percent!), 98th for theme, and… less good for everything else:</p>

<h3 id="the-making-of">The making of</h3>
<p>The heavy lifting in the code was done by a 2D game library called <a href="http://melonjs.org/">melonJS</a>. It was very nice to work with and I’d use it again.</p>

<h4 id="bom-bom-bom-bom">Bom bom bom bom</h4>

<p>The rules of the competition state that all assets (e.g. graphics and sound) must be created within the 48-hour window. I did all the sound effects on <a href="http://www.bfxr.net/">bfxr</a>, and the music with my own mouth. Sadly, I didn’t get around to putting in a mute button for the music, but I think the sense of agitation it evokes after about 8 seconds of listening really contributes to the overall feel.</p>

<h4 id="making-it-better">Making it better</h4>

<p>My flatmate, true to form, looked up from his own entry to peer over my shoulder and then put me onto a ridiculously good presentation by <a href="http://www.vlambeer.com/">Vlambeer</a> about improving the ‘game feel’ (although that’s a term they contest).</p>

<p>It came with an interactive demo, which sadly seems to have disappeared, but the talk it accompanied survives and is great: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJdEqssNZ-U">Jan Willem Nijman - Vlambeer - ‘The art of screenshake’</a>.</p>

<p>The talk is filled to bursting with rich wisdom nuggets, but with my short time allowance, I chose to implement a just few of the improvements I thought would be most effective:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Upping the shoot frequency</li>
  <li>Upping the bullet size</li>
  <li>Adding some screen shake</li>
</ul>

<p>The astonishing difference these small changes can make is hard to believe without watching that talk but you get some of the effect in these before and after gifs.</p>

<p>Post tweak:
<img src="http://static.lrnk.co.uk/blog-content/beneath-this-cool-calm/beneath-new.gif" alt="after-tweak" /></p>

<p>In conclusion, this was my first timeboxed game/code jam and I enjoyed it a lot and will absolutely commit doing it or something similar again one of these days.</p>
